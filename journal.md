The file journal.md is a diary of your progress. It contains dated entries with a description of what you are doing, what you found, what you are thinking, and so on. It is mainly a resource for you, but I will glance at it too (at the end of the semester). Please update and commit it at least once per week.

Week 6:
Attempt to find suitable topic and dataset. I want to choose a topic on extreme weather prediction or mitigation and urban planning.

Week 10:
Went to a conference and a competition the past two weekends and didn't make much progress. 
Learned about Professor Talea Mayo's research at the conference about math for coastal flood risk analysis:
 - Hurricane floods in New Orleans and in Lousiana
 - Statistical analysis of storm surge
 - Risk assessment of storm surge by prediction and categorization
 - Hydrodynamic modeling using conservation of mass and conservation of energy
 - WRF modeling includes climate change factors
 - Computations of the following:
   - Tropical cyclone intensity, size, translation speed; civil infrastructure, costal population dynamics and demographic shifts, multihazard
I was inpired by climate change impacts on regional flooding and sought for using the similar modeling method in a heatwave project.

Currently, I am looking at the paper "Analog Forecasting of Extreme-Causing Weather Patterns Using Deep Learning" by Ashesh Chattopadhyay, Ebrahim Nabizadeh, and Pedram Hassanzadeh, and the associated dataset that can be found at https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/community-projects/lens/data-sets. I want to examine if how adding climate change assumption and constraint to the modeling will change from the result in this paper. 

Week 12:
I am building models to assess how well local infrastructures in different cities reflect and accommodate the local extreme weather risks. Specifically, I am trying to find correlations between exposure to risk of heatwaves and local investment in heatwave mitigations.
