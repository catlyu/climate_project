Ideas on improving TSS:
- its definition is still fuzzy - especially because it depends on overall MAE, which in term depends on the data we have
- Needs more research into cri
- Needs more interpretability
- This can be generalized to other sensitivity scores, for example, how sensitive to coastal searches, earthquakes, etc.
