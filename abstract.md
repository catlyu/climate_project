This paper investigates the correlation between temperature variations and the Climate Risk Index (CRI) using machine learning models. It introduces the Temperature Sensitivity Score (TSS) to quantify the impact of temperature extremes on regional climate risks. The findings highlight significant variations in climate sensitivity across countries, underscoring the necessity of region-specific strategies in addressing extreme and detrimental climate events. The TSS emerges as a critical tool for guiding urban planning and emergency response, with implications for improving climate resilience.
